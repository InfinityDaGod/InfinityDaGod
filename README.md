### Hello ðŸ‘‹
I'm inf1n1ty.I'm a otaku (someone that likes to watch anime and play games) I mostly watch anime but I do play games a bit.

Can't lie, anime is really the best thing in the world, like my status says, if you don't like anime don't talk to me.

By the way, can you guess what anime those people are from?
